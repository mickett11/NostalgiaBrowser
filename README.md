# NostalgiaBrowser
 So i just had this idea that started while i was chatting with a bunch of people on a Discord server, and the idea was about making a retro style browser that works with modern protocols and web services, that seemed cool to me so it may look cool to other people as well.  Since javaScript processes or high HTML coded websites cannot be executed on a browser with a I1 browser mechanism, such as early Internet Explorer, Mosaic or Netscape, i decided that it would be cool to see a browser of that style and nature, that actually works with modern internet stuff, so that’s what i’ve decided to do.
